            I was born in Los Angeles, California and i've been homeschooled my whole life! I Just turned 19 on December 18.
            I started writing songs in 2015 with my best friend and brother Finneas, he also writes his own songs.
            In 2018 I released my first album when we fall asleep where do we go? Which led me to being the youngest person, and the second in history to win the four main Grammy categories.
            I'm currently working on my new album and will be ready to release very soon!
